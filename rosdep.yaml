# Python qt bindings.
#
# There are two providers: pyqt and pyside.  Pyside is only available
# for oneiric and pyqt is available for lucid and oneiric.  If on
# lucid, we require only pyqt, and if on oneiric we require both (for
# our own edification, not because both are necessary as far as any
# end-use is concerned).
#
# Pyside has the better license.  Pyqt is older, so is available on Lucid.
#
# Pyside packages required:
#   python-qt4 python-qt4-dev python-sip-dev python-qt4-gl
# Pyqt packages required:
#   python-pyside.qtcore python-pyside.qtgui libpyside-dev libshiboken-dev shiboken libgenrunner-dev
